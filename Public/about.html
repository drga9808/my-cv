<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I am a technology enthusiast. I've been playing with computers since I 
  was a child and have always tried to understand how they work. My desire to know how every
  device works led me to pursue a degree in telecommunications and electronics engineering.
  This journey gave me the basic knowledge and skillsto be able to understand how technology
  works and how we humans use it every day to solve our problems in almost every branch of 
  society.
</p>

<p>My passion in technology is mmore oriented to programming and networking. I love the Internet of 
  Things (IoT). I have done some research on this topic and have discovered the enormous range of
  applications in which this technology can be used to solve many of the problems we face today.

<p>
  During these last few years I have started my journey to becoming a web developer, as it is a
  very useful skill that will help me to complement old knowledge and at the same time, complete
  old unfinished projects.
